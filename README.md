## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - Greedy Approach
This implementation uses a **greedy algorithm** to approximate a solution for the TSP:
- Starting from an initial city, it iteratively selects the closest unvisited city, minimizing travel cost at each step.
- After visiting all cities, it returns to the starting point to complete the tour.

### Steps
1. **Distance Matrix**: Distances between cities are computed using `geopy` and stored in a matrix.
2. **Graph Creation**: Using `networkx`, cities are represented as nodes in an undirected graph with edge weights as distances.
3. **Greedy Algorithm**: The first edge considered is the one with the least weight in the graph and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited city, producing a full route upon return to the start.

### Limitations
The greedy approach is efficient and easy to implement but does not guarantee an optimal solution. Itâ€™s often used as a starting solution for further optimization methods (e.g., simulated annealing).

The function `tsp_cost` computes the total cost of the generated path.

## Evolutionary Algorithm for TSP Optimization
To improve upon the greedy solution, an **evolutionary algorithm** is implemented to search for lower-cost paths in the TSP. This approach leverages genetic operations such as crossover and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions over several generations.

### Evolutionary Steps
1. **Initial Population**: 
   - A set of candidate tours (routes) is initialized. 
   - The population includes the initial greedy solution and additional random tours.

2. **Selection**: 
   - The population is sorted based on tour cost, keeping the best-performing tours to form a "parent pool" for the next generation.
  
3. **Crossover**:
   - New tours are generated by selecting pairs of "parents" from the top solutions and performing **Order Crossover (OX)**:
     - A segment from one parent is copied to the child, while the remaining cities are filled from the other parent to retain a valid tour.
   
4. **Mutation**:
   - Each child has a probability of undergoing mutation, which swaps two cities within the tour to introduce diversity and explore new paths.
   - This helps avoid local minima and improves convergence.

5. **Generation Loop**:
   - For a set number of generations, new populations are formed, selecting the best tours from each generation, performing crossover and mutation and repeating.

### Limitations and Improvements
While the evolutionary algorithm enhances the initial greedy solution, the process can be computationally expensive, especially with larger datasets. Adjusting the **population size** and **mutation rate** based on the dataset size (number of cities) can help balance performance and optimization effectiveness.

The final solution is the route with the lowest cost across all generations, calculated by `tsp_cost`.

This approach provides a more flexible method to approximate an optimal path in the TSP, though it may still be improved with further refinements like adaptive mutation rates or hybrid algorithms.
